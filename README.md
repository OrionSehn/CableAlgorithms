# CableAlgorithms


This is a thin hosting for sharing results of routing algorithms with others. 

It uses github pages, and serves as a place to serve results of algorithms with others.

## Cable Routing Compendium

This is a compendium of various problems, constraints, and considerations for cable routing.

It is a work in progress, and is not yet complete.

## Early work

Here's a list of early work. Includes running routes using some simple shortest path aglorithms, with various cost functions, and some early work on defining the problem.
