# CableAlgorithms


This is a thin hosting for sharing results of routing algorithms with others. 

It uses github pages, and serves as a place to serve results of algorithms with others. 

<!-- main link: https://orionsehn.github.io/CableAlgorithms/ -->

There is no code in this repository, but there are links to various markdown files with summaries of work, and a compendium of problems and constraints related to cable routing.

## Cable Routing Compendium

This is a compendium of various problems, constraints, and considerations for cable routing.

It is a work in progress, and is not yet complete.

## Early work

Includes running routes using some simple shortest path aglorithms, with various cost functions, and some early work on defining the problem.

## Cable Support Problem

Focusing on the simplest undocumented formulation of the construction cable routing problem.
