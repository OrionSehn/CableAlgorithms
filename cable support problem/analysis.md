# Cost Functions
```math

dist(e) = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}
```


```math

c(e) = dist(e)


```

```math
t(e, \pi) = dist(e)*6
```

Note: Cost functions can be defined in various ways. The above is just one example, where the cost of an edge is its length, and the cost of placing a tray on an edge is 6 times its length. Different cost functions can be used to reflect different priorities or constraints in the problem. This includes factors such as height, congestion, accessibility, installation cost, fill rate, and more. The choice of cost functions can significantly impact the solutions generated by the algorithms, and should be carefully considered based on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.

These are very simple cost functions which very loosly reflect the real world costs of cable and tray placement. In practice, more complex cost functions would likely be needed to capture the various factors that influence the cost of cable and tray placement in real projects.
